*Operating systems without a decent [CommandLine|command line]. This primarily means [MicrosoftWindows|Microsoft Windows], although supposedly now they have a reasonable command line called [PowerShell].
* [TherapyBullshit|Therapy Bullshit]: the Inner Child, Oprah Winfrey, sensitivity training etc.
** "Not to be aware of a miserable childhood is prima facie evidence, in the eyes of Recovery, of "denial" - the assumption being that everyone had one, and is thus a potential source of revenue. The cult of the abused Inner Child has a very important use in modern America: it tells you that personal gievance transcends political utterance, and that the upward production curve of maudlin narcissism need not intersect with the descending spiral of cultural triviality. Thus the pursuit of the Inner Child has taken over just at the moment when Americans ought to be figuring out where their Inner Adult is, and how that disregarded oldster got buried under the rubble of pop psychology and specious short-term gratification." (Robert Hughes, _Culture of Complaint_, p.6-7) 
* Monarchy. I just about tolerate the current Queen of the United Kingdom, Mrs. Elizabeth Windsor. Her son is a complete waste of space, and is the best argument for republicanism ever to walk the earth. He's also a dangerous buffoon who promotes idiotic alternative health crap like coffee enemas instead of things that work.
* The inability of otherwise rational and logical people to apply the standards they'd use when evaluating whether or not to purchase a used car to other aspects of their lives. This most notably applies to religion, or rather epistemological and metaphysical meta-religious questions - for instance, the misapplication of the word 'faith' to absolutely everything by a whole array of idiotic, self-serving columnists who wouldn't understand the Gettier Problem if it sneaked up behind them and gave them a surprise goatse.
* The Religious Right: Jerry Falwell, Pat Robertson, James Dobson and all the other intolerant asshats who want to control people's lives.
* Misapplication of the Pareto Principle to things which it is less than optimally suited. Aeroplanes should not be subject to the "80:20" rule, or popular misunderstandings thereof.
* Members of the nontheist community who reflexively dismiss academic philosophy, and then always try and make exceptions for the philosophers they like by somehow arguing they aren't philosophers (Dennett, Bertrand Russell etc.)
* Pride in one's own mental incompetence. Example: Sarah Palin.
* Most newspaper opinion columnists. They seem to make tremendous amounts of money writing sophistry and cant about things which they know very little about. There are exceptions to this rule, but for the most part, opinion columnists are a bunch of tossers.
